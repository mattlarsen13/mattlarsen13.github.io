            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio Website! I am a student at the University of South Carolina, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Business Information Management.</p>
            <p>During my time at the University of South Carolina, I have developed my skills greatly as a programmer. Some langauges include Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Some other areas I have been developing are my skills around different terminals. This includes Mac, Windows, and Linux. I am excited to continue my journey at South Carolina and develop my skills as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with family and friends doing things such as sports, working out, and traveling.</p>

                    <h3>PickleUp - Sports App</h3>
                    <p>My friend I feel like there is no efficient way to get a group of players together for pickleball. This app's goal is to change that. This uses Swift and Xcode to create a Twitter-like API and adds specific features to fit our pickleball needs.</p>

                    <p>This is a personal project that has been in development for the past semester. Using my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created an NFL stat sheet for star players with the functionality to add and remove players as well.</p>
