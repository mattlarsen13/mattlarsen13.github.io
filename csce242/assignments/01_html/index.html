        <p>
            This page is here to help you learn about all things about the moon! Did you know the moon still has footprint marks fron the 12
            astronauts that have walked on the moon? This is due to the moon being geologically dead, not causing earthquakes or volcanoes. Here
            are some more fun facts about the moon.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The moon formed over 4.5 billion years ago!</li>
            <li>The moon is slowly inching away from the Earth 1.6 inches a year.</li>
            <li>It takes 27.3 days for the moon to completely rotate the Earth.</li>

        <p>Have you ever wondered based off those footprints who was the first person to step on the moon? That man was Neil Armstrong
            and he holds that title of first man on the moon. The goal by president John F. Kennedy was to send a crew to space and return 
            in 1961. As we have seen in the history books, Neil and 2 others succeeded in that task and were the first to walk on the moon! 
            Here is some more information on those three astronauts.
